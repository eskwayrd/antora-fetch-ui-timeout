= Demo repo to test Antora UI fetch timeout

When there are many images in an Antora project, the UI can fail to fetch with a timeout error.

This repo contains a very simple Antora project with a single page and a single image.

The `generate_images.js` script makes copies of the one included image, by default 80,000 times:

[source]
----
node generate_images.js 50000
----

Then, when Antora runs, an error should report that the UI could not be
fetched due to a timeout:

[source]
----
npx antora --staxcktrace --fetch antora-playbook.yml
----
